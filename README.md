# About-Me-Website
Created as project #2 in the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree. Created the HTML and Stylesheets to match the provided design mockup.
This website is pretty basic, but there are some interesting things to point out:
* Media queries help make the design reactive
* Most font sizes are dependent on the screen's width, which turned out pretty cool!
* Flexbox adds responsiveness to smaller screen sizes with relatively little markup changes

Credits (I used a number of websites as resources, these were particularly helpful):
* Udacity HTML, CSS and Responsive Design courses
* hipsterlogogenerator.com for the logo
* w3schools.com 
* MDN
* StackOverflow
* css-tricks.com
